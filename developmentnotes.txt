Development notes:

1. do you have the relational database structure file? NASP Discovery Project Database blabla
to help guide which fields would be displayed there.

on the left with the internal accounting fields I think we'll need date of transaction,
 credit/debit amount, name of client,and of course the memo field +++
 
 
all the major stuff from the grande livre pdf there,on the right hand side,
where it says "PDF record 1",and you click on it and get more info.
I want it to display 3 things.  amount, date, company,and you click on it and get more info.
and the more info should have the other important info
including memo field, account number... everything significant about the record in the database basically
and of course we'll need the search buttons and stuff, but that goes without saying +++


after that's done
we'll have to figure out the scripts for getting the files from the databases and linking them together
what sort of searches will be most effective
and marios will need to be in on that bad boy because he's been coddling the data


for the first demo
we'll have a toggle button that says "include linked records in search" +++


Xanto:and about that, can something be linked with two pdf records?

Nath:let's think this through
 we do have a few multi-page documents
 hmmm
 

but this will be for the next iteration, it's not a right now priority
for the first demo
we'll have a toggle button that says "include linked records in search"
and potential matches that are already linked will come up in red
if someone thinks the link was made in error they can flag it +++




-Search bar above PDF Records.+++

-Different data options / Combo Search +- Extra field +++

-Pdf_Records with Author = Automatic 

-SKip button in lower right hand corner+++

-Instead of "Fixed", "Undo Error"++

-Instead of "Undo", say "Unlink"+++

-Skip Button Tooltip to say: "Only Skip if there is no obvious match."+++

-Skip confirmation. Are you sure? (If it is Skipped, it goes out of the records pool)+++

-Low priority : Error Panel to Select typical types of Records or Comment if you dont find them. (If I can do that in a sort amount of time)+++
 
-Low priority : Background to a solid one, instead of patterned+++

-Remember to fix the Date Search, which right now isn't working properly 

-Remember the Auth, and to change the "Modification Author" each time someone Links, Flags or Skips a Record
 


Command to Load Data to Database: python manage.py loaddata "D:\01_Projects\Important Shit Projects\On the Go\EVS Nathan Project\MariosDjango\Fixtures\AmalgamatedOutput.csv.json"


Data entry tooL:

-remember to make KeyDown Enter for the input text areas, if possible! Right now it is TAB!
-yeah.  a checkbox or button or something so that if the first search doesn't work out, it will move to other categories, "Extra results", or "Extend Search"

Type of output:

-Document Discovery Report: Exhibit Number, Document Title (Either Automatic or Manual), Description of some sort, Page Number. Able to Turn Off any of those fields

Feedback on Entry Tool on 10_10_2013:

-It didn't add the New Company to the Company List when saved
-Work on the speed of the fade-outs when you click outside. +++
-"Done" button to enter fields or some more definitive way of how to enter data. --- Not doing that because the interaction is already messy enough.
-Team Leader in admin can undo the superuser priviledges by using his action, and modify the superuser.
     He should only see people with his group assigned.
     Try to make the Grouping automatic for each Leader.
     Also, the Grouping is not working. The marked users are not staff, or even active.

-Should tell what Company Fields are incorrect when closing the Company window, instead of the other one. +++
-Country should autofill when choosing the City. +++
-No Autofills in Input Text Areas (HTML Defaults that remember what you wrote before)++?
-Focus all the menus out when you focus in on something +++
-"Cheque number" should appear insted of Document Number, once that is filled. --
-Extra case for when all the records are completed. +++
-Currency from an Array and also Autocomplete like COmpany Name, City, etc. +++
-Make the Company Form bigger so City and Country are later, and so it can fit without scrolling.+++
-Change MouseOver for MouseClick, in the Menus.
